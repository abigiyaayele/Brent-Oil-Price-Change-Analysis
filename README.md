# Change Point Analysis and Statistical Modelling of Time Series Data

## Project Summary
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Brent oil prices, focusing on the impact of significant political and economic events. Using advanced statistical and econometric models, we aim to detect change points in time series data and associate these changes with key events. The goal is to provide actionable insights to investors, analysts, and policymakers for better decision-making.

## Project Overview
Birhan Energies, a leading consultancy firm, specializes in providing data-driven insights and strategic advice to stakeholders in the energy sector. This project involves studying how important events such as political decisions, conflicts in oil-producing regions, global economic sanctions, and changes in OPEC policies affect Brent oil prices. The analysis focuses on detecting change points in the time series data of Brent oil prices and understanding the underlying causes.

## Introduction
The oil market is highly volatile due to various geopolitical and economic factors. This volatility poses challenges for investors, policymakers, and energy companies in making informed decisions. Detecting change points in time series data can help identify significant shifts in oil prices and their causes, aiding in risk management and strategic planning.

## Objectives
- **Primary Objective:** To study the impact of significant political and economic events on Brent oil prices.
- **Sub-Objectives:**
  1. Define the data analysis workflow and understand the model and data.
  2. Extract statistically valid insights in relation to the business objective.
  3. Analyze Brent oil prices using advanced statistical and econometric models.
  4. Explore other potential factors influencing oil prices.

## Learning Outcomes
### Skills
- Statistical Modelling
- Using PyMC3 - a Bayesian modelling package in Python
- Running and modifying moderately large Python packages

### Knowledge
- Probability distributions and choosing the relevant one for a given task
- Bayesian inference
- Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)
- Model comparison
- Policy analysis

## Methodology and Steps
### Defining the Data Analysis Workflow:
- Clearly outline the steps and processes involved in analyzing the Brent oil prices data.
- Ensure a comprehensive understanding of how the data is generated, sampled, and compiled.
- Understand the model inputs, parameters, and outputs.
- Identify and state any assumptions and limitations of the analysis.
- Determine the main media channels and formats for communicating results to stakeholders.

### Understanding the Model and Data:
- Read key references related to the project to grasp the key concepts and models.
- Familiarize yourself with models suitable for time series analysis, such as ARIMA or GARCH.
- Explain the purpose and application of these models in the context of analyzing price fluctuations.
- Identify the processes that generate the data and how these are modeled by the chosen time series models.
- Describe the expected outputs and limitations of the analysis and how predictions are made.

### Analyze Brent Oil Prices
- Build on the foundational understanding of time series analysis.
- Apply this knowledge to analyze historical Brent oil prices data.

### Utilize Additional Statistical and Econometric Models
- Explore advanced time series models like VAR, Markov-Switching ARIMA, and LSTM networks.
- Analyze potential factors influencing oil prices, including economic indicators, technological changes, and political/regulatory factors.

### Adapting the Model to a New Scenario
- Apply the analysis framework to different scenarios or related datasets.
- Extend the model to incorporate new variables or data sources.
- Validate the modelâ€™s performance in predicting future price movements and other outcomes.

## Suggested Approach
### Data Collection:
- Gather comprehensive datasets on economic indicators, technological changes, and political factors from reliable sources like World Bank, IMF, IEA, and industry reports.

### Data Preprocessing:
- Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- Handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies appropriately.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Perform EDA to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.
- Use visualizations to gain insights into the interactions between different variables and oil prices.

### Model Building:
- Develop multiple models to capture different aspects of the data using time series models, econometric models, and machine learning algorithms.

### Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the models using performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
- Compare the models to identify the best-performing ones.
